Created using Visual Studions 2019 on Windows. Inluded the use of SFML as an external library. Build the project as a solution. 

//**DISCLAIMER**//

In order to actually run this program, you must tell the compiler where to find the SFML headers. Again, I did this using Visual Studios 2019 so the exact steps on doing this might be different for other ocmpilers. The steps on how to do this can be found at the sfml website on the tutorials page. I have decided to simply include their documentation as they would definitely do a better job explaining the steps than I could.

This project was cerated with C++ and inludes many different C++ concepts such as dynamic memory allocation and dealing with the corresponding memory leaks, reading in files, storing file information in data structures, and more. This project is a little incomplete as it does not include all the functions that are part of a traditional game of minesweeper, but I hope you will still enjoy.
